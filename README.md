##A javascript calculator (assignment from the Odin Project)

Second ever javascript project.  Has issues that I may never feel like coming back to resolve...we shall see...

####Possible future work:
* negative/positive button<br>
* other typical calculator buttons (memory, powers, sqrt, etc)
* Main issue: does NOT handle floating point numbers well :)
